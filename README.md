This is a tribute page to Florence Nightingale for her contributions in Nursing, Statistics, Feminism Movements and Literature Freedom.

This Tribute Page listed her quotes, her legacies over the years in her life, and how she continue to inspire people. 
As well as how people discribed her as a kind and intelligent person. <br><br>

I hope this page can make you learn more about her and continue to support her beliefs.<br><br>
